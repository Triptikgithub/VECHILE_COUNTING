A vehicle license plate scanner in computer vision is a type of computer vision application that can be used to identify plates and read their numbers. This technology is used for a variety of purposes, including law enforcement, identifying stolen vehicles, and tracking down fugitives.

A more sophisticated vehicle license plate scanner in computer vision can scan, read and identify hundreds, even thousands of cars per minute with 99% accuracy from distances up to half a mile away in heavy traffic conditions on highways and city streets. This project is very useful in many cases. 

The goal is to first detect the license plate and then scan the numbers and text written on it. Itâ€™s also referred to as an automatic number plate detection system. The process is simple:

Capture image,
Search for the number plate,
Filter image,
Line separate using row segmentation,
OCR for the numbers and characters.
